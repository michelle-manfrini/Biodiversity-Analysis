# Biodiversity-Analysis

This goal of this project was to analyze the biodiversity in National Parks. Specifically, to study the distributions of conservation status for different species in the varying parks. It was important as the analyst to understand the characteristics of the species, their status, and their relationship to the national parks.

Two csv files are given, ('observations.csv') and ('species_info.csv'), the first with the observations of each species within the different parks and the other with species specific information.
